##Summary - 

This chart indicates the departure delays for flights within US in 2008. We can see how the delay pattern develops through out the year, and which carriers are responsible for highest ratio of delays.

We see a consistent pattern that the least chance of a delay is when you travel in May or October. The peaks are June-August and December holidays. The above pattern applies to most of carriers, even with the top performing carriers: OH and YV. 

##Design - 

I'm interested to see how the ratio of delays per total flights varies over months. I expect line chart to best represent this: x-axis will show months of year and y-axis will show the ratio (percent). Since we want to know how differnet carriers compare against each other, there will be one line chart per carrier, showing the individual performance. All lines would share the same primary color, but I'll add a 'focus' effect to pop out the line chart on mouse hover. 

We can see that carriers with least delay ratio are OH (Comair Inc.) and YV (Mesa Airlines Inc.). If you also hover your mouse over individual carriers, you can observe a pattern that peak dealys happen in summer and winter holiday months.
